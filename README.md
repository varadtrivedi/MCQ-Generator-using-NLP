MCQ Generator using NLP

An intelligent Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Generator that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically create questions, options, and answers from any given text or PDF.

This project leverages spaCy, NLTK, and Streamlit to process text, extract key entities, and generate meaningful MCQs with distractors â€” all through an easy-to-use web interface.
